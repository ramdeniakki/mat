# HTTP Server Interaction

This project demonstrates how to create and manage an HTTP server, handling client-server interactions. The server is designed to receive and respond to HTTP requests, process data, and potentially interact with various APIs or databases. Below is an overview of the setup, technologies, and usage.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/http-server-interaction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd http-server-interaction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the HTTP server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with it via:
   - Curl commands
   - Postman
   - Browser requests
   - Frontend clients or other servers

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                             |
|--------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/`              | Returns a welcome message               |
| GET    | `/status`        | Returns server status and uptime        |
| POST   | `/data`          | Accepts JSON payload and processes data |
| PUT    | `/update/:id`    | Updates data for the given `id`         |
| DELETE | `/delete/:id`    | Deletes data for the given `id`         |

## Technologies

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for building the server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building HTTP server and APIs.
- **JSON**: Data format for request and response payloads.
- **Postman / Curl**: Used for testing API endpoints.
