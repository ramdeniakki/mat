# Headers

HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent between a `client` (like a web browser) and a `server` in an HTTP request or response. They convey metadata about the request or response, such as content type, auth information etc.

**Common headers**

1. Authorization (Sends the user auth information)
2. Content-Type - Type of information client is sending (json, binary etc)
3. Referer - Which URL is this request coming from


## Request headers

The headers the `client` sends out in the request are known as request headers

## Response headers

The headers that the `server` responds with are known as the response headers.
