# Headers

HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent between a `client` (like a web browser) and a `server` in an HTTP request or response. They convey metadata about the request or response, such as content type, authorization information, etc.

## Common Headers

1. **Authorization** - Sends the user authentication information.
2. **Content-Type** - Specifies the type of information the client is sending (e.g., JSON, binary).
3. **Referer** - Indicates the URL from which this request originated.

## Request Headers

The headers that the `client` sends out in the request are known as request headers.

## Response Headers

The headers that the `server` responds with are known as the response headers.
